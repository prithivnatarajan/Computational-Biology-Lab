Reference:

In [184] = Tree of all specimens
In [217]/[218] = Count all A and G for all specimens
In [283] = Plot of A/G % for all specimens
In [290] = Defining the clusters of size 4 each with high distance in the Tree
In [306] = Box Plot
In [404] - In [421] = Counting and percentages
In [422] = Cluster 1 plot Orange is A/T and Blue is G/C
Till In [425] = Cluster 4

Algorithm used:

1. Define Clusters 
2. Use AlignIO for the sequence and count length of each specimen and store them in another list
3. Use counter lists to count for each A/t or G/C
4. Plot
